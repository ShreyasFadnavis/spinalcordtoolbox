Computing metrics for gray/white matter regions and tracts
##########################################################


This tutorial will demonstrate how to compute metrics using the gray/white matter segmentation masks. The tutorial will also go over how to compute more granular metrics across individual gray matter regions and and white matter tracts (using the PAM50 GM/WM atlas).
