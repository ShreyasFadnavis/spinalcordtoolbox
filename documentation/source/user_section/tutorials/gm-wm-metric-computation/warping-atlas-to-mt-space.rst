Transforming the GM/WM atlas to the MT space using warping fields
#################################################################

In order to use the PAM50 atlas to extract and aggregate image data, the atlas must first be transformed from the unbiased PAM50 coordinate space to the space of the data you wish to compute metrics for.

In this case, we will be demonstrating how to extract MTR for specific white matter tracts. Thus, the atlas needs to be transformed to the space of the MT data.

To transform the template, it is necessary to have a warping field that defines the transformation between the PAM50 space and the anatomical space. Warping fields are generated by registering the anatomical data to the PAM50 template. This process is demonstrated in the following tutorial pages:

* :ref:`registering-additional-contrasts`
* :ref:`gm-informed-mt-registration`

The command below assumes that the warping field is already present in your working directory.

.. code:: sh

   sct_warp_template -d mt1.nii.gz -w warp_template2mt.nii.gz -a 1 -qc ~/qc_singleSubj

:Input arguments:
   - ``-d`` : Destination image the template will be warped to.
   - ``-w`` : Warping field (template space to anatomical space).
   - ``-a`` : Because ``-a 1`` is specified, the white and gray matter atlas will also be warped.
   - ``-qc`` : Directory for Quality Control reporting. QC reports allow us to evaluate the results slice-by-slice.

:Output files/folders:
   - ``label/template/`` : This directory contains the entirety of the PAM50 template, transformed into the MT space.
   - ``label/atlas/`` : This direct contains 36 NIFTI volumes for WM/GM tracts, transformed into the MT space.

Once the command has finished, at the bottom of your terminal there will be instructions for inspecting the results using either :ref:`Quality Control (QC) <qc>` reports or :ref:`fsleyes-instructions`.

Now that the atlas has been warped to the MT space, it can be used to extract MTR for specific white matter regions.
